# CO227-PacketForwardingSimulator
Packet Forwarding Simulator for CO227 Project


#Compling#

*create a new javaFX project in your IDE

*create a source folder in it.if already created keep it and delete anything inside it(eg: .fxml files or anything else)

*copy and paste sample,images folders into above mentioned empty src folder.

*make sure to set the compiler to run main method in Main.java not the main method in Simulator.java
(that's probably y we get dat nullpointer exception)

if it seems like any background images are not rendering, set the paths correctly in corresponding .fxml file
